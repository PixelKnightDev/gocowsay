/ Has everyone noticed that all the letters of the word "database" are   \
| typed with the left hand?  Now the layout of the QWERTYUIOP typewriter |
| keyboard was designed, among other things, to facilitate the even use  |
| of both hands.  It follows, therefore, that writing about databases is |
\ not only unnatural, but a lot harder than it appears.                  /
